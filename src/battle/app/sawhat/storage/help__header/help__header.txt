There's plenty of way writing a header.  
*Setext style* is obtained by appending `=` or `-` signs in a the line above the header text:
    Header 1
    ========
    Header 2
    --------

*Atx style* uses 1 to 6 `#` character in the front of your header text to define H1 to H6 header levels:
    # Header 1
    ## Header 2
    ###### Header 6

*Sawhat style* let you add two different styled headers by appending `=` and `-` signs in font of the header text in a *reversed Atx style* way:
    ===== Underlined header 2
    ----- Normal header 2
    ==== Underlined header 3
    ---- Normal header 3
    = Underlined header 6
    Normal header 6 cannot be written with - signs.

**_Side notes_**  
H1 level shouldn't be used in *Sawhat* as the card title is already a first level header.  
For the sake of the writers please choose a syntax and stick to it (we recommend the **Sawhat style**).  
Header level increase if you insert a card in an other card.
Please avoid H5 and H6 header levels because they shouldn't exist at all, if you have more than 4 level of header in your document you should think about refactoring it and/or subdivide your card.  
In *Atx* and *Sawhat* syntax you can &quot;close&quot; your headers like this `==== H3 ====`, some likes to have it bigger.
