You can add header using this markdown syntax:
    Header with border:
        ===== header text =====
        ===== header text
    Header without border:
        ----- header text -----
        ----- header text

The header level depends on the number of &quot;=&quot; or &quot;-&quot; sign you add: 5 represent a &quot;h2&quot;, 1 is for &quot;h6&quot;. &quot;h5&quot; and &quot;h6&quot; can only be written with &quot;=&quot; signs but don't worry, you shouldn't use them anyway.
&quot;h1&quot; is the card title.
Note that the header level increase if you insert a card in an other card.

Here what headers will look like:
===== H2
----- H2
==== H3
---- H3
=== H4
--- H4
== H5
= H6
