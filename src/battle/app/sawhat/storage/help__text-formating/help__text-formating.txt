A paragraph is one or more line followed by an empty line. Because of this, you have to specify when you want to make a `&lt;br&gt;` (aka. *newline*) by adding two space at the end of the line.

You can _emphase text_ by wrapping it with `*` or `_` characters. To make **strong text**, wrap it with double `*` or `_`.  
Stroke ~~word~~ text is done by wrapping it with `~~`.

Some special characters are available by wrapping uppercase characters in parenthesis like R, C and TM :  
(R) (C) (TM)  
Power users will know how to make a &lt;3 ;-)
