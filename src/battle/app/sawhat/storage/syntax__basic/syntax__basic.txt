===== Emphasis and special characters =====
A paragraph is one or more line followed by an empty line. Because of this, you have to specify when you want to make a `&lt;br&gt;` (aka. *newline*) by adding two space at the end of the line.

You can _emphase text_ by wrapping it with `*` or `_` characters. To make **strong text**, wrap it with double `*` or `_`.  
Stroke ~~word~~ text is done by wrapping it with `~~`.  
Multiple wrapping is possible (**_~~what ?~~_**) but not recommended in a readability point of view.

Some special characters are available by wrapping uppercase characters in parenthesis like R, C and TM :  
&gt; (R)  
&gt; (C)  
&gt; (TM)  
&gt; Power users will know how to make a &lt;3 ;-)

You can always escape a charcater used in te syntax by adding a backslash `\` before :
&gt; \*banana\*



===== [#]Links =====
Classic markdown [link](http://www.example.com) are made like this: `[link text](http://www.example.com)`.  
You can add a [title to your link](http://www.example.com &quot;Example title&quot;) by adding it right after the url like this: `[link text](http://www.example.com &quot;Link title&quot;)`.  
You can also directly type an url to create an automatic link http://example.com.

For lisibility, you can also use [reference links][1] using this syntax `[link name][link_id]`. This referenced link will be defined at the end of your document by using this syntax `[link_id] http://exmaple.com &quot;Link title&quot;` (of course *title* is optional).

To create an anchor to link to, add `[#]` before the word you want to be the anchor.  
You can then create a [link](#Links) to it.

===== Images =====
Image syntax looks like url beginning with an exclamation mark: `![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg &quot;Optional title&quot;)`  
Like for url, you can just be lazy and type the url to your image directly.
&gt; Here is `![Windows icon](http://res2.windows.microsoft.com/resources/4.2/wol/shared/images/win8_logo_144x144.png &quot;Windows icon&quot;)`  
&gt; ![Windows icon](http://res2.windows.microsoft.com/resources/4.2/wol/shared/images/win8_logo_144x144.png &quot;Windows icon&quot;)

You can also add image attached to a card by copying the link name `@somegibberish.jpg` at the bottom of the card you attached the file to (pfff!)!  
@b5e4bcadb285767b704504140af9cfa5.gif

Please keep in mind that there's no way to define image size for now, large images will use 100% of the card width.



===== Headers =====
There's plenty of way writing a header.  
*Setext style* is obtained by appending `=` or `-` signs in a the line above the header text:
```
Header 1
========
Header 2
--------
```

*Atx style* uses 1 to 6 `#` character in the front of your header text to define H1 to H6 header levels:
```
# Header 1
## Header 2
###### Header 6
```

**[#]Sawhat style** let you add two different styled headers by appending `=` and `-` signs in front of the header text in a *reversed Atx style* way:
```
===== Underlined header 2
----- Normal header 2
==== Underlined header 3
---- Normal header 3
= Underlined header 6
Normal header 6 cannot be written with - signs.
```

--- Side notes ---
H1 level shouldn't be used in *Sawhat* as the card title is already a first level header.  
For the sake of the writers please choose a syntax and stick to it (we recommend the [**Sawhat style**](#Sawhat)).  
Header level increase if you insert a card in an other card.
Please avoid H5 and H6 header levels because they shouldn't exist at all, if you have more than 4 level of header in your document you should think about refactoring it and/or subdivide your card.  
In *Atx* and *Sawhat* syntax you can *close* your headers like this `==== H3 ====`, some likes to have it bigger.

--- Header examples ---
&gt; ====== H1 ======
&gt; ===== H2 =====
&gt; ----- H2 -----
&gt; ==== H3 ====
&gt; ---- H3 ----
&gt; === H4 ===
&gt; --- H4 ---
&gt; == H5 ==
&gt; -- H5 --
&gt; = H6 =



===== Lists =====
Unordered lists are made by using asterisks `*`, pluses `+` or hyphens `-` as markers.  
You can nest multiple list by adding indentation (using *Tab* key).
&gt; - un-
&gt; - -ordered
&gt;    - list
&gt;    - in
&gt;    - list
&gt; - list

Ordered lists use a number followed by a period `.`.  
&gt; 1. add items
&gt; 2. order them
&gt; 3. profit !
