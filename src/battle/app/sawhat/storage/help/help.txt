===== Main principles 
[**Sawhat**](https://github.com/labelcarrote/BattlePHP) is a card based wiki.  
As it is a wiki, you can edit everything the way you like for everyone but unlike other *classic* wiki, the card based interface means there's no hierarchical link between cards. It's more like you'd have a gigantic post-it (R) wall with a search functionality.

===== Syntax
Syntax is based on [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) with some adjustments.
