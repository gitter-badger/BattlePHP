You can write code inline by surrounding it with ` ` `.

    Power users can write block of code
    by tabbing the text
    (like this one)

Specific code language can be syntaxicaly colored by using the specific ````language_name` tag before a block of code.
Supported languages currently are: php, javascript and css.

    ```php
    // this is an exemple of php code
    function some_php_code($id=null){
        echo 'banane';
        exit(0);
    }

    ```javascript
    /* this is an example of javascript code */
    var code_exmaple = function(){
        alert('some JS code&quot; !');
        return true;
    };
